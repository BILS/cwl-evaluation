# Resequencing analysis example

The idea here is to implement the [Resequencing analysis
pipeline](http://uppnex.se/twiki/do/view/Courses/NgsIntro1502/ResequencingAnalysis.html)
from Scilifelab's NGS intro course, as has [partly already been done in other
tools](https://gist.github.com/samuell/6da9a7c1e03912fde62e).

Note that there are a number of pre-existing community-made tool definitions in
[this repository](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/workflows/tree/master/tools)
that could most probably be re-used in this demo.
